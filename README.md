# Rust parser and interpreter for the MFEL language

- refer to syntax.mfel in the examples folder for a quick description of the language syntax with examples.

- the interpreter takes a single argument: the name of the program to run.

- if omitted, it falls into a read-eval-print loop with no editing. code snippets have to fit on a single line.
